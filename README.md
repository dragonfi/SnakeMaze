This time with slight puzzle elements.

Controls
--------

* Move with the ARROW KEYS,
* SPACE to restart the game,
* press ESC to return to the menu.

Licensing
---------

I DO NOT release this code under an open-source license.

On the other hand, I put this code on github.com, so
that you can learn from it, and maybe tinker with it
for your own amusement.

Just make sure that you don't re-distribute it. Thanks.

That being said, if you want to contribute or have a
strong argument on why should I use a license,
feel free to start a discussion.
